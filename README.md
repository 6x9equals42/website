# ENGRI 1101 Course Website

*Note: The course website was previously maintained [here](https://github.com/engri-1101/textbook)*

This repo maintains the ENGRI 1101 course website. The site is hosted on
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) which references the `gh-pages`
branch. To protect against unintended changes to the active website,
development should be done on development branches and then merged into
`master`. When ready, changes to master can then be deployed by merging
`master` into `gh-pages`.

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), shortest path, and Minimum Spanning
Tree (MST) labs were created in most part by Travis Wilson (tw454).
Additional demos were created by Henry Robbins (hwr26).
